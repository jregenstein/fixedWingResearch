# Fixed Wing Research
## Purpose
To compile information and resources on flying fixed wing drones to ease the setup and research process for future researchers. For the most part, these things can be googled with varying difficulty, but we've compiled this information here for your convenience. If you want to add to the documentation, [here's a markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Research Goals
Summer 2016: Set up hardware and flight modes in fixed wing planes for future use.
Potential projects: Long-line loiter maneuver (allows stable payload drop), map parcel B, solar powered drone

### Things you will find here:
- **[Pre-flight Checklist](https://github.com/olinrobotics/fixedWingResearch/blob/charlievweiss-patch-1/FixedWingPilotChecklist0.2.docx)**

 Refer to this every time you fly, to avoid crashes. Seriously.
- **[Transmitter Setup](https://github.com/olinrobotics/fixedWingResearch/blob/charlievweiss-patch-1/Transmitter%20Setup.md)**

 This will walk you through how to set up the transmitter, to make sure the control surfaces move the right way in each flight mode, and how to mix certain channels so flight mode assignments work correctly.
- **[Basic User Guide](https://github.com/olinrobotics/fixedWingResearch/blob/charlievweiss-patch-1/basicUserGuide.md)**

 Here we've compiled a bunch of information on flight mode and failsafe parameters. Please refer here if you have any questions or weird bugs, because there are a lot of random things that affect what you want to do.
- **[Captain's Log](https://github.com/olinrobotics/fixedWingResearch/blob/charlievweiss-patch-1/captainsLog.md)**

 This is a record of our flight tests starting Summer 2016.
