#Captain's Log
## This is a log of all our flight tests as of 27 July 2016.

### 28 July 2016 5:30-6:00 p.m.
Goals: Perform first-pass long line loiter maneuver with Appr S.

Flight 1: Waypoint mission didn't work, as the DO_SET_SERVO waypoint (which moves a servo releasing the payload) had an altitude of 0 and refused to update. **Must troubleshoot.** Tried maneuver manually-- Servo dropped payload successfully, but string caught and payload swung around wildly ~5 ft below aircraft (it was meant to hit the ground). Uncontrollable CG made flight difficult. Pilot (Jacob) managed to dive and pull out, causing the weak link to break and release the payload, and landed unscathed. It was hilarious. Will try a more reasonable spooling method next pass to prevent string entanglement.

### 27 July 2016 5:00-6:00 p.m.
Goals: Same as earlier

Flight 1: Secured Bixler wings with duct tape. Flew beautiful large circles in loiter (Pilot:Jacob). Got Appr S in the air, but it wobbled a bunch and loitered very unstably. Pilot (Charlie) lost control near the end, but landed without damaging the plane. Freakin' nailed the land, actually. Turns out one of the rubber bands holding the wings on snapped, so the wings were coming off in flight. **Note: add wing security check to pre-flight checklist**

Flight 2: Secured Appr S wings with duct tape (shh). Flew beautiful circles below the Bixler (Bixler 80m, Appr S 70m), tighter and faster. Both landed beautifully.

### 27 July 2016 2:20-3:00 p.m.
Goals: Check CG with Apprentice S (newly equipped with GoPro) and Loiter with Bixler. Take data with both planes in air.

Flight 1: Bixler wings flexing too much, landed early. Solution: Find other velcro strap.

Flight 2: Appr S CG works, but controls are more unfriendly. Affects pitch. Bad land-- nose hit ground and plane flipped, but only landing gear needs adjustment.
