#Captain's Log
## This is a log of all our flight tests as of 27 July 2016.

### 27 July 2016 2:20-3:00 p.m.
Goals: Check CG with Apprentice S (newly equipped with GoPro) and Loiter with Bixler. Take data with both planes in air.

Test 1: Bixler wings flexing too much, landed early. Solution: Find other velcro strap.

Test 2: Appr S CG works, but controls are more unfriendly. Affects pitch. Bad land-- nose hit ground and plane flipped, but only landing gear needs adjustment.
